//Experienced travelers know that if small items are packed last, they can fit snugly in the odd gaps in nearly filled luggage.
//This motivates a smarter strategy:  process the items from biggest to smallest.
//The worst-fit decreasing heuristic is to do worst-fit, but first preprocess the file sizes so that they are in descending order.
//A modular way to implement this heuristic is to write a separate program IntegerSorter.java that reads in a sequence of integers and prints them out in descending order.
//Then you can pipe the results through your worst-fit heuristic.
